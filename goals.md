# Goals

## Overall
* Have an efficient Shiny app (searchable)
* Easy for users to use
* Explanation of what we did and how to use the app

## Shiny
* Create function for boxplots?
* Display summary stats by artist?
  * Mean/median of all the variables
  * Total songs
  * Total albums
  * Genre? (later on, will have to access API again)
* Graphs of variables (have a user choose the variable) (DONE)
* Explain potential problems (DONE)
  * Some artists' names are spelled differently (DONE)
  * Errors in Spotify data (DONE)
* Shiny colors (DONE)
* `{ggplot}` customization
* Publish app online

## Ian
* Import multiple datasets? (DONE)
* Look up what the variables actually measure (DONE)
* Post on GitHub (two issues: loading data, dropdown menu) (DONE)
* Reorganize the server (DONE)
* Function for graphs (DONE)
* New tab for table of variables
* Edit table in readme (DONE)
* Look at publishing
* Feather (DONE)

## Stacy
* Start running eda  (DONE)
* Looking at random characters (DONE)
* Customize ggplot graphs (Partially done, moved to Sarba)
* Theme of the app (DONE)
* Customize text on app
* Color of Button
* Summary stats/homepage

## Sarba
* Make new variable in dataset with just the year (DONE)
* Remove duplicates in the data (DONE)
* Some EDA (DONE)
* Adding comments to file to explain our decisions (DONE)
* ggplot customization
* Summary stats?


# Learning Objectives

How can we show that we are meeting the objectives?

## Import, manage, and clean data

We have shown we can import data and manage it with the `{tidyverse}`. We will each need to show more on cleaning data because this data is pretty clean.

## Create graphical displays and numerical summaries of data for exploratory analysis and presentations

This is the purpose of the project. We will be creating a lot of graphs and visualizations of our data to show to users.

## Write R programs for simulations from probability models and randomization-based experiments

We will need to show elsewhere probability and simulation.

## Use source documentation and other resources to troubleshoot and extend R programs.

We used a package for basic EDA. This will need to be worked on.

## Write clear, efficient, and well-documented R programs

We will do this. Includes adding comments to explain decisions and what the code does. Can type in comments and in the .rmd text spaces.
